        The city of Exampleopulus is a large city that spans three separate counties, each of which 
         has their own tax laws.
        Your job is to implement some code that will help residents of the city determine what the 
         tax will be for various purchases.
        As part of your solution you will need to use the following parameters that are passed in to the method:
            A String variable county which indicates in which county the purchase is being made.
            A String variable product which indicates what type of product is being purchased. 
            A String variable paymentMethod which indicates how a person intends to pay for their purchase. 
    
        1) Declare a double variable with the identifier taxRate. 
        2) Use If, Else If, and Else statements to construct a program that correctly adjusts 
            the tax rate based on the following codes:
    
        NOTE: If you have a tax rate of 3%, it should be the double value 3.0, not .03

         and junk food and have the following rules:
            * The base tax rate for any purchase in the county is 1.5%
            * An additional 2% tax is levied on Tobacco and Alcohol products.
                * An additional 5% tax is levied if the purchaser uses a Cash payment method. 
            * An additional 1.5% tax is levied on Potato Chips and Soda Pop products.

        Richland County is home to many of the city's massive shopping centers and have the following rules: 
            * The base tax rate for any purchase in the county is 3%
            * To protect the counties bookstores from online retailers any Books products have a 
               1% tax regardless of any other taxes.
            * An additional 1% tax is levied on Clothing products. 
            * An additional 2% tax is levied on Shoes products. 
            * Because most people don't carry large amounts of Cash, there are additional taxes 
               based on payment method:
                * An additional 1% tax is included for any purchases using a Credit payment method. 
                * An additional 0.5% tax is included for any purchases using a Check payment method.
                
        Park County is on the edge of the city and far more spread out and has the following rules:
            * The base tax rate for any purchase in the county is 2%. 
            * Any products which are not Food have an additional 1% tax levied on them with the following exceptions:
                * The tax rate for Alcohol products is always 5% regardless of other taxes.
                * The tax rate for Shoes and Clothing products is always 0% regardless of other taxes. 
            * Using either Credit or Cash as a payment method has a 1% tax rebate (i.e. reduction) 
             
        If a valid County is not entered, the value Double.NaN should be returned. 
         
        NOTE: If you have a tax rate of 3%, it should be the double value 3.0, not .03
        NOTE: You do not need to include "County" when checking the county. Check for "Dale", "Park", or "Richland"
