    /*  For this Challenge problem we're going to simulate a high-stakes gambler who is willing to risk everything on thin odds.
        This gambler is an unscrupulous character and has no problems fixing the outcome in order to haul in large amounts of money. 
        Our gambler does not settle for mere wagers, but will bet every cent to increase winnings according to a multiplier (i.e. double/triple or nothing)
    
        You will make use of the following parameters that are passed to this method as arguments: 
            A double variable, factor, which serves as the multiplier in the event that a wager is won
            A Boolean variable, outcome, which indiciates whether or not a particular wager will be won or lost
        
        You will also make use of the following instance variables that are a part of this class:
            A double variable, money, which serves as the amount of money the gambler has. 
    
        If the gambler wins a wager, the output should be: 
            I've won and have $money now.
                Where $money is the amount of money the gambler now has.
        If the gambler loses a wager, the output should be: 
            I've lost and have nothing!
    
        Challenge:
        1) Implement a single-statement solution for this problem. 
        2) Make sure your single-statement solution formats currency winnings to look nice. 
        3) Make sure your single-statement solution can randomly generate a fair result if the variable outcome is null.
