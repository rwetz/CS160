    /*
     * For this portion of the assignment you will be writing some basic arithmetic expressions.
     *
     * Note: You should declare and initialize any variables as a single statement (i.e., using a single line of code)
     *
     * When you are finished, you can run the unit tests located in the Question5Test.java
     *  file to verify the correctness of your solution.
     * Note: This class does not contain a main method so you should not run this program.
