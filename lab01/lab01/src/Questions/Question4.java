     * For this portion of the assignment you will be working with String
     * concatenation and escape sequences in addition to using the pre and
     * postfix operators from incrementing and decrementing variables.
     *
     * Four (4) variables have already been declared and initialized below as
     * part of this assignment. You will be using these variables as part of
     * your solution.
     *
     * Each of the parts below will involve using String concatenation, escape
     * sequences, and one of the pre or postfix operators.
     *
     * Note: You should declare and initialize any variables as a single
     * statement (i.e., using a single line of code)
     *
     * When you are finished, you can run the unit tests located in the
     * Question4Test.java file to verify the correctness of your solution. Note:
     * This class does not contain a main method so you should not run this
     * program.
