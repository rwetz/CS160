     *  indicating what data type and identifier should be used for each variable
     *  or constant. In some cases you will select a literal value of your own choosing.
     *
     * You should declare each of the variables or constants below based on instructions in the comments.
     * Note: You should declare and initialize each of the variables or constants as part of
     *  the same statement (i.e., on the same line).
     *
     * When you are finished, you can run the unit tests located in the Question2Test.java
     *  file to verify the correctness of your solution.
     * Note: This class does not contain a main method so you should not run this program.
