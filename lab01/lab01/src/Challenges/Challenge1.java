     * For this challenge, add a single statement to the method below (you should put
     *  it below the appropriate comment) that will allow you to decrease the value
     *  of x by 1 and increase the value of z by 2. It is trivial to do this using 
     *  multiple separate statements, but the challenge is for you to accomplish
     *  this using a single statement.
     *  
     * Extra challenge: Try solving the problem without using any int literals as
     *  a part of your solution.
