    /* For this portion of the assignment you will be working with the String class
     *  and using several different methods of the String class to manipulate String
     *  variables.
     *
     * You may need to refer to table 3.4 in chapter 3.7 to determine which methods you
     *  should use. Additionally, you may want to look at the API for the String class:
     *  https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html
     *
     * When you are finished, you can run the unit tests located in the Question3Test.java
     *  file to verify the correctness of your solution.
