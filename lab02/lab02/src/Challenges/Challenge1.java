    /*
     * In class we demonstrated that is was possible to explicitly typecast any of the primitive
     *  data types (other than boolean) to any of the other primitive data types (other than boolean)
     *  even if it didn't necessarily make a lot of sense to do so. 
     * 
     * Assume that we want to be able to use Strings to perform mathematical calculations
     *  and that we want to be able to treat a String as a int value, no matter the contents
     *  of that String. In other words, adding the String "15" to some other number is just
     *  as desirable as being able to add the String "No" or "?" to some other rnumber. 
     *
     * Write some code that will convert the variable inputString which is passed as an argument
     *  to the method below to an integer, consistent with the way that Java would convert
     *  a long to a byte or an int to a short. If you're doing this correctly the String "Fred"
     *  will have an int value of 6619236. 
     * 
     * Extra Challenge: If the String contains a number (e.g. 157) that represents a valid
     *  int value then the method should return that result. 
     * 
     * More Challenge: Ensure your method works no matter what the length of the inputString is (or if it is null)
     * 
     * I Have Nothing Better To Do Levels Of Challenge: Write the entire method using only a single Java statement (line of code)
