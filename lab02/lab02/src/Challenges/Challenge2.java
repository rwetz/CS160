     * One type of simple problem that is very common in simple algorithms involves swapping two different values.
     *  Typically this is done by creating a temporary third variable to store the value of one of the others and
     *  then discarding it like in the following example:
     * 
     *  int x = 15;
     *  int y = 45;
     * 
     *  int temp = x;
     *  x = y; 
     *  y = temp;
     * 
     * Suppose that you have two variables of type int that have values between 0 and 100 and that there is insufficient
     *  memory to allocate for a temporary variable. Write some Java code that will allow you to swap the values in the
     *  two variables in the method below without declaring and using any temporary variables. 
     * 
     * Extra challenge: Do not use the "exclusive or" (XOR) bitwise operator or simulate one through the combined use of
     *  other bitwise operators. 
     * 
     * More challenge: Do not use any bitwise operators at all as a part of your solution.
