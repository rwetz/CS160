         * For this portion of the assignment you will be working with static methods of the Math class.
         *
         * Additionally we will be using variables that are passed as parameters to a method.
         *  If you look immediately above these instructions you will notice what's referred to
         *  as a method header. Among other things, this header specifies 7 variables, 3 of type int
         *  and 4 of type double. These are parameters to a method and you will be using them as part
         *  of your solution. Because the declaration for these variables has already been done as
         *  part of the method header, it is not necessary for you to declare any of the
         *  variables a, b, c, d, x, y, z that you will be using in the instructions below. You can
         *  use any of them by using their identifier as a part of your code.
         *
         * Note: The unit tests for this file will not run until all parts have been completed.
