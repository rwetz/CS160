    /**
     * For this challenge we are interested in simulating a loaded die that is more likely
     *  to return certain values than others. Your job is to implement some code in the
     *  method body below that will allow you to accomplish this. 
     * 
     * You can run this file as the main method will call your method several thousand times
     *  and report on the statistics to determine if you were successful in your endeavor. 
     * 
     * Initial challenge: Write the following method such that is produces any significant
     *  bias (e.g., a 3 is more likely than other numbers) in the results at all. 
     *  
     * More challenge: Write your method such that it makes the results 1, 2, or 3 twice as 
     *  likely as getting a 4, 5, or 6. 
     * 
     * Even more challenge: Write your method so that it only requires a single statement.
     * 
     * I said give me a challenge: Don't use the String class or arrays as part of your solution.
     * 
     * All of that was still baby stuff: Make your method twice as likely to return a 2, 4, or 6
     *  than a 1, 3, or 5 while still following all of the rules above.
